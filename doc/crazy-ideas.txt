Crazy ideas
===========

1. A JavaScript preprocessor to do things like count k-mers (HLL), and do
   diginorm on data as uploaded to server.

   Inspired by a paper that Titus reviewed for PLoS One; not yet published.

2. Scaling diginorm: one idea is to load data until the hash table FP rate
   max is reached, then ditch the hash table and start over again.
