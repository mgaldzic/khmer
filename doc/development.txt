Development miscellany
======================

Python command-line scripts should use '-' instead of '_' in the name.
(Only filenames containing code for import imported should use _.)

Please follow the command-line conventions used under scripts/.  This
includes most especially standardization of '-x' to be hash table size,
'-N' to be number of hash tables, and '-k' to always refer to the
k-mer size.

All code in scripts/ must have automated tests; see tests/test_scripts.py.
Otherwise it belongs in sandbox/.

@@CTB: to squash output, or not to squash, by default?
