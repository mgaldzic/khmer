A short HOWTO on comparing assemblies
=====================================

We regularly get e-mails and see blog posts telling us that people
got better (or worse) results with diginorm/partitioning/etc than
with other approaches.  It is often hard to evaluate these statements,
but we *really* do want to be able to evaluate them, because we want
to make sensible recommendations to people and figure out how to
improve our own software and protocols.

In that vein, here are some points to keep in mind:

- please keep track of exactly what you did, so we can understand
  and discuss it without guessing.

- if you can give us access to your data, that's even better; then
  we can run it ourselves, too.

- if you can do your assembly without diginorm and partitioning, that's
  great! We've developed these techniques to make assembly easier and
  faster, so if you're happy with your current pipeline, you may not
  need to use them.

- diginorm and partitioning may both alter the "best" parameters for your
  assembler, so you can't do "apples to apples" comparisons by running the
  same assembly command pre- and post-processing.  For example, with
  Velvet, you need to use different 'k' and expected-coverage values
  before and after diginorm.

- khmer protocols and advice focuses on sensitivity over other measurements.
  If your interest is in maximizing (for example) contig length, you'll
  have to adapt appropriately.

- please don't use N50 or summed bp for transcriptome and metagenome
  comparison!  In neither case are they good measures: transcriptomes
  may have many different splice variants, and metagenome stats may
  depend critically on polymorphism structure; neither of these can be
  measured by N50/summed bp.

- in the microbial world, some great assemblers have been developed
  that may obviate the use of khmer+diginorm.  For example, SPADES and
  IDBA may do better jobs on your metagenomes and single-cell data
  than khmer+diginorm.  It seems to depend quite a bit on your data.  If you
  run into obvious cases where khmer+diginorm performs better, or worse,
  please do let us know.

- evaluating eukaryotic genome assemblies is *hard*; see Assemblathon 2.
