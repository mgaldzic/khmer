get callback from partitioning working again!

also 1 bit/hash table entry, for basic partitioning?  (REDUCE MEM USAGE/FP)

replace memory structures for map, set to be cheaper; see Matt Austern's
  treatise.

run velvet??

probably want to randomize which group files different partitions go into...?

TODO in the future
----

put locks around the I/O functions.

Distribute distribute_setup.py alongside setup.py.
    (Allows us to cleanly rely upon a modern setuptools.)
    (Can always evaluate distutils2/packaging when it becomes viable....)

Get rid of Makefiles. Drive entire build from setup.py.
    (Removes dual Make/setup.py build system.)
    (Improves chance of building on Windows. No nmake or VS crap.)

Remove dependency on screed.
    (Not in PyPI - pain to install.)

Add dependency on argparse. Ditch argparse distributed with khmer.
    (Can be automatically installed for Pythons which don't have it.)

Use SWIG for Python wrapper around C++.
    (Pure Cython - atomic ops? I/O performance tuning? probably bad idea...)
